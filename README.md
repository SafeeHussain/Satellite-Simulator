# Satellite Simulator

## Objective
- Make a satellite simulator using python
    - hopefully get a working satellite simulation which has its behaviour similar to the games from Kerball Space Programme or Spaceflight Simulator 

## To Do 
- [x] Actually start the project
- [ ] Get a working circular oit)
    - [ ] Ensure that the code works for different types of orbits
    - [ ] Good coding practices and etiquacy is enforced
- [ ] Learn how to use qt python
    - [ ] Go through tutorial on how to use qt to start your own application
    - [ ] Make the simulation work in real time
    - [ ] From there, learn its used for the satellite simulations
        - Work on a 2D satellite orbit simulation in real time
         
## Plans
- [x] Get a basic matplotlib simulation done
- [ ] Working real time satellite orbit
- [ ] Implement 3D variations
- [ ] Get actual satellite data and implement in the simulation
- [ ] Accept player input controls
    - [ ] Update the trajectory respectively to the player's input
- [ ] Create a controller for aligning to a mission orbit
- [ ] Multi body satellite simulations
