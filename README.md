# Satellite Simulator

## Objective
- Make a satellite simulator using python
    - hopefully get a working satellite simulation which has its behaviour similar to the games from Kerball Space Programme or Spaceflight Simulator 

## To Do 
- [x] Actually start the project
- [ ] Get a working circular oit)
    - [ ] Ensure that the code works for different types of orbits
    - [ ] Good coding practices and etiquacy is enforced
- [ ] Learn how to use qt python
    - [ ] Go through tutorial on how to use qt to start your own application
    - [ ] From there, learn its used for the satellite simulations
